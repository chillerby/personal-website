### Hosting a static website using Hugo and AWS S3

I built this website using the static website generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) written in Golang. I knew I wanted a static website as opposed to a live one because of the reduced overhead of web server configuration, upkeep, cost and speed. My use case was simply to display some of the stuff I have worked on and to keep track of it all and because I wanted to. I had a good look around before deciding which framework to use and finally settled on Hugo after reading [this blogpost](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/top-static-site-generators-for-2019-26a4c8afcc05).
